# Bleublanc

Bleublanc is enforcer-grade mock api response management library designed to support Cypress (maybe agnostic in future).

## What's inside?

Use your application as-is and record the API responses that can be used later in `cy.intercept`.
Bleublanc will also help to manage and maintain your mocks, giving you a dashboard to update/delete/verify your mocks and the live server.

### Apps and Packages

- `sample-ui (port:3000)`: sample UI application that uses `bleublanc`
- `sample-api (port:4001)`: sample API server that serves `sample-ui`
- `web (port:3099)`: tentative bleublanc web ui - mock management dashboard
- `docs (port:3030)`: a docusaurus app for bleublanc docs (currently empty ^^)
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications generated by turborepo
- `config`: `eslint` configurations generated by turborepo (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
